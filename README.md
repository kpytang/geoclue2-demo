geoclue2-demo
=============
Example for how to use <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/GeoClue/">GeoClue2</a> 
to grab location information and display that in a map. 

The base class (<code>geoclue2lib.py</code>) is based off of the repo 
<a href="https://github.com/parinporecha/GeoClue2-Locator-python">here</a>. 
I've repackaged it a bit so that it could more easily be used by others.

To see how to use the class, take a look at the <code>main</code> method inside 
<code>geoclue2lib.py</code>. Otherwise, you can also look at <code>geoclue2-demo.py</code>.

This code requires that you first install geoclue2, libchamplain, libchamplain-gtk.
