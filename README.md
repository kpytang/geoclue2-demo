geoclue2-demo
=============
Example for how to use GeoClue2 to grab location information and display that in a map. 

The base class (<code>geoclue2lib.py</code>) is based off of the repo here. It was repackaged and abstracted a bit more. 

To see how to use the class, take a look at the <code>main</code> method inside <code>geoclue2lib.py</code>. 
Otherwise, you can also look at <code>geoclue2-demo.py</code>.

This code requires that you first install geoclue2, libchamplain, libchamplain-gtk.
